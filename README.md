Cron Format
==========================

Goals
-------------------------
Give you an idea of what the cron schedule is without having to refer to the cron syntax.

Avoid crons that do something other than what you expect.

What is supported?
-------------------------
The best way to figure out what is and is not supported is to try out the gui application.

mvn package

java -jar gui/target/cron-format-gui-1.0-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar
